- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m @MavisLu0

- ðŸŒ± I am currently a participant in the training programme by Generation Singapore and Temasek Polytechnic in partnership with Microsoft on Business Intelligence and Data Analyst (Junior Data Engineering). The training programme focuses on the below technical skills required to be a successful Data Engineer:
- Languages: SQL, Python
- Platforms: PostgreSQL, Microsoft Azure, Jupyter notebook, Github
- Database Design, Data Pipeline Development
- Application Programming Interface (API)
In addition, I have acquired a lot of hands-on practices through simulations and role plays. 

- ðŸ‘€ I have grown to be interested in the technological sector and want to pursue a role in the Data Science Industry. Hence, I would want to continue to stay on and learn more about the industry so as to keep myself abreast with the future.

Previously, I graduated with a Bachelor of Business (Management) with Distinction, majoring in Finance and minoring in Human Resources from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University from the SIM campus. I also worked in the banking industry for close to 9 years and 8 months with UBS before taking part in the training programme.
